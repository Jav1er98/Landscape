## Landscape

## Introduction

The objective of this project was to create a third-person game using Unreal Engine 5. The game features a character exploring a detailed environment consisting of an open landscape with a small enclosed structure. The environment includes both natural and artificial lighting elements, with a focus on visual aesthetics and interactive gameplay mechanics.

## Environment

The environment design encompasses three distinct areas: a forest, wetlands, and a snowy region. Each area is represented by separate material layers, providing visual variety and enhancing the immersive experience. Paths have been strategically placed throughout the landscape to guide the player towards a specific destination, with signage in the form of rocks or signs to assist with navigation. Additional effects, such as fog and volumetric lighting, are used to create a more immersive and visually captivating experience.

## Interactive Object

An interactive object of importance is placed inside the closed structure. When the player enters the "range" of the object and performs the "collect" action which in this case is with the "E" key, the object disappears from the scene, giving the player a "special" power. that causes signs to appear indicating the direction of the path to the end.

## Details
Visual details play a significant role in enhancing the overall atmosphere of the game. The interior environment showcases signs of deterioration over time. Lighting within the interior environment is a static  lighting, with lightmaps and color adjustments contributing to the desired mood. 

## Aesthetics

To enhance the overall aesthetics, a variety of external assets are used for vegetation, rocks, and other objects within the landscape. Deferred Decals are employed to add further visual enhancements, including dynamic signage, cracks, foliage, and other details to simulate deterioration and create a more realistic environment.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this Unreal Engine 5 project successfully demonstrates the creation of a third-person game with a captivating environment. The combination of an expansive exterior landscape, a detailed enclosed structure, and various interactive and visual elements provides an engaging player experience. The implementation of lighting techniques, material customization, and object interactions showcases the capabilities of Unreal Engine 5 for game development.
